Divergent is set in the future, in a dystopian version of Chicago that has been divided into five factions: Abnegation, Candor, Amity, Dauntless, and Erudite. The protagonist and narrator is a sixteen-year-old girl from Abnegation named Beatrice Prior.

The novel opens with Beatrice’s mother cutting her hair. Beatrice is worried about the next day’s aptitude test, which is administered to all sixteen-year-olds and will tell her which of the factions she is best suited for. After the test, she will attend the Choosing Ceremony, where she must decide whether to stay in her family’s faction or leave it behind.
